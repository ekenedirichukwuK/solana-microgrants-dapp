# Solana Microgrants DApp

A decentralized micro-finance platform built on Solana to empower underbanked communities by enabling transparent peer-to-peer microgrant distribution.

## 🚨 Problem Being Solved

Over 1.7 billion people worldwide remain unbanked. Many have brilliant ideas or pressing needs but no access to traditional credit, grants, or financial tools.

Trust issues, high fees, and bureaucracy often block aid from reaching those who need it most. We're solving that with decentralized, transparent microgrant funding — powered by Solana.

## 🎯 Vision

To build a decentralized, censorship-resistant micro-finance system that helps:
- Creatives and builders from underbanked communities get funded.
- Donors and backers directly support causes they believe in.
- Communities coordinate funding transparently using DAO mechanisms.
