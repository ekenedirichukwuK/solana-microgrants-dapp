# Solana Microgrants DApp - Grant Application Pitch

## 🧠 Problem Being Solved
Billions of people globally remain unbanked or underbanked, excluded from formal financial systems due to high fees, low credit scores, or geographical limitations. Traditional grant-making and financial aid systems are centralized, bureaucratic, and prone to inefficiencies, limiting access to urgent funding for small community projects or emerging changemakers.

## 🌍 Our Vision
We envision a world where anyone, anywhere, can launch, fund, or vote on micro-scale community projects using a censorship-resistant, decentralized platform powered by Solana.

Our DApp—**Solana Microgrants**—will empower grassroots leaders, NGOs, and local creators with seamless tools to:

- Launch funding campaigns transparently  
- Receive donations globally via Solana Pay  
- Enable token-based voting on which projects to fund  
- Provide impact reports and track success in real-time  

## 💡 Unique Value Proposition
Unlike GoFundMe or centralized platforms, our solution offers:

- **Decentralization** — No middlemen. Campaign creators control their funds.  
- **Transparency** — All funding activity is publicly verifiable on-chain.  
- **Community governance** — Projects can be voted on by token holders.  
- **Speed and affordability** — Solana enables fast, low-cost microtransactions.  

## 🧱 Tech Stack
- **Solana Web3 SDK** – Smart contract integration  
- **Anchor Framework** – For Rust-based on-chain programs  
- **Next.js + TailwindCSS** – Fast and responsive frontend UI  
- **Phantom Wallet** – Seamless wallet login  
- **Solana Pay** – P2P and campaign donations
