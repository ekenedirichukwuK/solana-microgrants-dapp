# Solana Microgrants dApp 💸

A decentralized micro-finance platform built on Solana to empower underbanked communities and amplify cause-driven impact through transparent, DAO-governed funding.

---

## 🚀 Problem We're Solving

Across emerging markets like Africa, millions of talented individuals and social ventures remain unfunded because they lack access to traditional capital systems. Micro-grants could change lives, but centralized platforms are limited, opaque, and prone to bias.

---

## 🌍 Our Vision

We're building a **decentralized micro-grants dApp on Solana** that enables:

- 📜 **Proposal Submissions** by users for funding with transparency.
- 🤝 **DAO Voting & Reputation Scores** to determine who gets funded.
- 💸 **Fast & Fee-light Payments** via Solana Pay.
- 🔍 **On-chain tracking** of grants, progress, and impact.

Built by and for emerging market builders who understand the problem firsthand.
